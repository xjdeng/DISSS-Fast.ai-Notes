# DISSS-Fast.ai-Notes
Applying Tim Ferris's [DISSS](http://www.businessinsider.com/tim-ferriss-disss-system-to-learn-anything-2015-3) Metalearning system to learn and create documentation for the [Fast.ai Deep Learning library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai)

This repository is still **Under Construction** and will be updated frequently.  It'll be organized into the following sections:

- **[Notes](https://github.com/xjdeng/DISSS-Fast.ai-Notes/tree/master/Notes)**: This is where I write down any key or interesting findings from each [Fast.ai lesson](http://course.fast.ai/index.html).
- **[Paperspace Protips](https://musicinformationretrieval.com/ipython_audio.html)**: Tactics and shortcuts for running your Fast.ai code on [Paperspace](http://www.paperspace.com) that wasn't covered in the course.
- **Summaries** (proposed): After completing the notes for each lesson, I'll create a 1-page summary for each lesson as per Tim Ferriss's DISSS system.  I envision creating summaries similar to the [Python cheat sheets on Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/data-science-cheatsheets).
- **Helpers** (proposed): This is where I'll write some helper functions to make some commonly performed routines even more efficient.
